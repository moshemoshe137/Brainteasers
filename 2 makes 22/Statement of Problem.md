Write an arithmetic expression using the number 2 exactly 7 times, using any of the
following arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, \*\*.

Your arithmetic expression will need to give a result of 22.

Note that, for this challenge, we will not be using brackets: we will complete the
operations from left to right without considering the rules of operator precedence. So
for instance:

- Without operator precedence: 2 + 2 + 2 * 2 = 4 + 2 * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12
- Whereas, when applying the rules of operator precedence: 2 + 2 + **2 * 2** = 2 + 2 +
  **4** = 4 + 4 = 8
