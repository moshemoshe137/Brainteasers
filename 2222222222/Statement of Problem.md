Let’s consider a string consisting of 10 characters “2”: string = “2222222222”

This computing challenge consists of writing an algorithm to work out the largest number we can create by inserting 2 multiplication operators (*) anywhere within this string.

For instance:

- 2 * 2 * 22222222 = 88,888,888
- 2 * 22 * 2222222 = 97,777,768
- 2222 * 2222 * 22 = 108,620,248
- 222 * 222 * 2222 = 109,509,048
- etc.
